# Usage

apodget.py can be run by itself. It will then try to download today's picture
into the current directory (failing that, yesterdays picture).

apodget.py also has methods available for fetching the APOD for a given date.

# TODO

Facilities for scaling/cropping and putting images as desktop background
in Windows.
